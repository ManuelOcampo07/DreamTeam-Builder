# PROJECT IDEA

The objective of this project is to create a website that allows users to build their very own soccer dream team.  
Users will be able to search for their favorite players and form a competitive team around them.  
The website will display a virtual football field where users can choose popular formations such as **4-3-3**, **4-2-3-1**, **3-5-2**, or **4-4-2**, and place players accordingly.
