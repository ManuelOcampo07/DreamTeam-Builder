## Project Description

DreamTeam Builder is a web API that allows users to explore and manage soccer player data to build their own “Dream Team”.  
It integrates a real-world FIFA dataset and provides advanced features such as:

- Player search by name, nationality, and position
- Filtering by rating, age, and potential
- Sorting and pagination
- Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
- MongoDB Atlas integration using Mongoose ORM

The backend provides structured JSON responses and can later be consumed by a frontend (React or HTML).
